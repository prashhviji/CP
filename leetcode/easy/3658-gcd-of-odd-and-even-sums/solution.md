**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/gcd-of-odd-and-even-sums/

You are given an integer n. Your task is to compute the GCD (greatest common divisor) of two values: sumOdd: the sum of the first n odd numbers. sumEven: the sum of the first n even numbers. Return the GCD of sumOdd and sumEven.

```java
class Solution {
    public int gcdOfOddEvenSums(int n) {
        return n;
    }
}
```
