# 3658. GCD of Odd and Even Sums

**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/gcd-of-odd-and-even-sums/

You are given an integer n. Your task is to compute the GCD (greatest common divisor) of two values: sumOdd: the sum of the first n odd numbers. sumEven: the sum of the first n even numbers. Return the GCD of sumOdd and sumEven.

```java
class Solution {
    public int gcdOfOddEvenSums(int n) {
        return n;
    }
}
```

## Mistake Analysis

TAGS: Logic Error, Algorithm Choice

1. **Key Issues**: Attempt 1 returns `n` without calculating `sumOdd` and `sumEven` or their GCD.  The algorithm is completely missing.

2. **Evolution**: No improvement shown as only one incomplete attempt is provided.  The code lacks the necessary formulas for calculating sums of odd and even numbers and a GCD function.
