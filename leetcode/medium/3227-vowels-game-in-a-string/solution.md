# 3227. Vowels Game in a String

**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/vowels-game-in-a-string/submissions/1767834881/

Alice and Bob are playing a game on a string. You are given a string s, Alice and Bob will take turns playing the following game where Alice starts first: On Alice's turn, she has to remove any non-empty substring from s that contains an odd number of vowels. On Bob's turn, he has to remove any non-empty substring from s that contains an even number of vowels. The first player who cannot make a move on their turn loses the game. We assume that both Alice and Bob play optimally. Return true if Alice wins the game, and false otherwise. The English vowels are: a, e, i, o, and u.

```java
    }
    private boolean isVowel(char c) {
        if (c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u') {
            return true;
        } else {
        }
        return true;
            }
                vowels ++;
        for(char c : s.toCharArray()){
            if(isVowel(c)){
        int vowels = 0;
            return false;
        }
        if(vowels ==0){
                return false;
            }
```

## Mistake Analysis

TAGS: Logic Error, Conditional Logic

1. **Key Issues**: All attempts incorrectly assume Alice wins if any vowels exist.  They don't consider substring removals and game strategy.  Attempts 2-4 have syntax errors (missing `return false` in `isVowel` and incorrect `vowels` declaration).

2. **Evolution**:  Attempt 1 is the most complete syntactically, but fundamentally flawed. Subsequent attempts show no progress in fixing the core logical problem; they only address the superficial syntax errors.
