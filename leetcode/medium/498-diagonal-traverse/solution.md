# 498. Diagonal Traverse

**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/diagonal-traverse/submissions/1747689710/

Given an m x n matrix mat, return an array of all the elements of the array in a diagonal order.

```java
            if (d % 2 == 0) {
                Collections.reverse(diagonal);
            }

            for (int num : diagonal) {
                result[index++] = num;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

## Mistake Analysis

TAGS: Logic Error, Loop Logic, Algorithm Choice

1. **Key Issues**: Attempt 1 is missing the core diagonal traversal logic.  It reverses diagonals inconsistently and doesn't correctly iterate through matrix elements. The code snippet is incomplete, lacking the loop that populates the `diagonal` list.

2. **Evolution**: No subsequent attempts were provided for analysis of improvement.  The provided code snippet is insufficient to understand a complete solution.
